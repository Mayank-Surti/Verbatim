# Verbatim

Verbatim is a web application that converts audio files into text using machine learning models running in the browser.

## Features
- Upload and transcribe audio files
- Optional text translation and export
- Runs ML models in-browser using web workers for fast processing

When a user uploads an audio file or records an audio clip, the app streams it into a machine learning model executed directly in the browser. Web workers handle the processing in the background to keep the interface responsive. Once the speech is transcribed into text, users can view, translate, or export the output.
